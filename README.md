# Hello 👋

🎓 I am a senior at UC Santa Cruz majoring in Psychology with a minor in Statistics. I will be graduating this June, 2025. I'm passionate about the intersection of psychology, and data. My interests include **data analysis**, **project management**, and **human resources**—especially how data-driven insights can support more inclusive and effective organizational practices.

📊 Here is where I will be sharing my code, research, and analsis of how union vs. nonunion wage gaps influence compensation strategies in HR through linear regression models.

🛠️ Experienced in MATLAB, R, Python, and qualitative coding methods
